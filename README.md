# fizzbuzz

FizzBuzz is a children's game to learn division. You are given a range of numbers, and you are to count incrementally. Although, when a number is divisible by 3, you should say "fizz", and when a number is divisible by 5, you should say "buzz". When both conditions are true for a number, you should say "fizzbuzz".
